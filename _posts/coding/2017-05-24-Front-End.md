很多人会混淆模块化开发和组件化开发。但是严格来讲，组件（component）和模块（module）应该是两个不同的概念。两者的区别主要在颗粒度方面。《Documenting Software Architectures》一书中对于component和module的解释如下：

> A module tends to refer first and foremost to a design-time entity. ... information hiding as the criterion for allocating responsibility to a module.
> A component tends to refer to a runtime entity. ... The emphasis is clearly on the finished product and not on the design considerations that went into it.
> 
> In short, a module suggests encapsulation properties, with less emphasis on the delivery medium and what goest on at runtime. Not so with components. A delivered binary maintains its "separateness" throughout execution. A component suggests independently deployed units of software with no visibility into the development process.

简单讲，module侧重的是对属性的封装，重心是在设计和开发阶段，不关注runtime的逻辑。module是一个白盒；而component是一个可以独立部署的软件单元，面向的是runtime，侧重于产品的功能性。component是一个黑盒，内部的逻辑是不可见的。
